# Sends a SHUT UP event to port ARGV[0]

# Since Roland E-80 (expensive though it may be) has no such button
# and aplaymidi violates the midi standard(!) by allowing ^C to interrupt
# it.

# NOW It does send (I think) the right bytes, but nothing ever happens.
# But I found another way to fix it. Restart the aplaymidi command and let
# it run to the end.
# What if I send 128 * 16 note off events?
# That causes EINVAL midway. Also bytes remaining in queue grows to 16380...
# So this learns us
#    the default queuespace == 16384 == 2**14
#    you MUST use a queue
#    The ALSA API proves ones more to be crappy.  There is nothing invalid about the parameters....
