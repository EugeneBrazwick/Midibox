Now, Eugene has a phylosofical argument with methods like 'lineTo'.
As these implement a change, and not a declaration.

Especially 'moveTo'.

A path can be seen as a series of segments where the pen stays on the canvas
while adding stuff.
Let's represent that with the [] array notation.

This implies that adding two arrays like [...], [...] will cause a moveTo to be
implied.
In that terminology a line is just a vertex. And a vertex can be represented as a tuple
[x, y].

[[0,0],[1,0],[1,1]],[0,0],[-1,0],[0,-1]]

I we know we are dealing with a path and not a vertex then we can also write
[0,0, 1,0, 1,1],[0,0, -1,0, 0,-1]

Then we must decide how a path is 'closed'.
I would say that 'closing' is the default case, and leaving it open is special.
To do this the single element :open is to be used.

In the end only 3 elements exist in a path;  move, line and curve.

So [[0,0],[1,1]] is moveTo(0,0), lineTo(1,1)
Next we can say line(0,0, 1,1) or line([0,0],[1,1]). And to add segments just do:
  line(0,0, 1,1, 2,0, 1,0)
However, it should not close automatically.
  curve
should work  the same, And it is possible to use both as components of paths:

[ line(0,0, 1,1), line(2,0, 1,0)]
Since an array represents a 'pen down' part, the [2,0] starting the second line is lineTo
and not a moveTo. In this sense [line(0,0, 1,1), line(2,0)] is identical to
[0,0, 1,1, 2,0].

To close a line or curve anyway you can use :close as last element. So
line(0,0, 1,1, 1,0, :close) is equal to [0,0, 1,1, 1,0] or [0,0, 1,1, 1,0, 0,0, :open]
The last one is :open logically, but closed if we look to the coordinates. I say it should
be avoided, for this ambiguity. But to create a closed curve we must use it.

So we compose the path of components:

  - vertex, cannot occur on its own. Always part of a polyline
  - line. If in front then the first one is a move, all others are lineTo, including :close.
  - curve. Same as line but now curves. However :close is a lineTo.
  - :close. lineTo first point of path, plus a moveTo(0,0) Any trailing components are ignored
  - ellipse. all basic shapes add closed subpaths and implicitely close the previous path.
             They cannot be put inside paths. [0,0, 1,1], ellipse(....), [....]
             Also repetition of arguments is not handled.
  - rect
  - roundedrect
  - path
  - region. A region is not unlike a path, except that only the fill is taken into account.
            Normally used to define a clippingzone. Instead of adding polygons, you
            add basic rectangles, ellipses or bitmaps using '|', '&', '-' and '^'
  - text. Text is put on the coord where x = left (or right), and y the baseline.
  - polygon. left open
  - arc. The first coordinate here becomes a moveTo or lineTo, which is the center of
         the passed rectangle. Followed by startangle (0 == +x) and sweep-angle ccw.
         at that point on the arc it is left open.  So arc can be embedded in [].
         arc(rect, ang1, angd). Angles are in degrees.
  - cubic. Similar to arc. cubic(p1, c1, c2, p2, c3, c4, p3, ....)
           [line(p1, p2), line(p3, p4)] the p3 is a lineTo(p3)
           [cubic(p1, c1,c2, p2), cubic(p3, c1, c2, p4)]. p3 is also a lineTo(p3)
           cubic(p1, c1,c2, p2), cubic(p3, c1, c2, p4). p3 is a moveTo(p3)
           line(p1, p2), cubic(p2, c1, c2, p3). We must duplicate the vertex. But:
           [p1, cubic(p2, c1,c2, p3)] is the same.
  - quad. Second degree version of cubic (faster but less fluid).
           quad(p1, c2, p2, c2, p3, ...)
  - subpath. Same as []

Lacking: arcMoveTo (moveTo point on arc, based on the angle and boundingrect)

Paths can be outlined, creating another path.
Also: intersection (&), union (|) or substraction.
In the end a path can only use 1 pen and 1 brush.
Translation and matrix mapping can also be done.

=begin
  subpaths are handled ambiguously by Qt.  Since closeSubpath always adds a straight line
  it is pretty useless for curves.
  So curves need one vertex extra, the endvertex is the same as the first one.
  See example:

      QPainterPath path;
      path.addRect(20, 20, 60, 60);

      path.moveTo(0, 0);
      path.cubicTo(99, 0,  50, 50,  99, 99);
      path.cubicTo(0, 99,  50, 50,  0, 0);

   The 0,0 vertex is twice in the path.
   If we make those vertices 'active' it would immediately show up.

   smooth p1, p2, p3

   is a moveTo p1, then cubicTo p2 and cubicTo p3. Since p1 and p3 are endpoints the controlpoints
   are p1 and p3 themselves.

   smooth p1, p2, p3, :close

   :close is a lineTo p1, and p1 will not be smooth, and neither will p3
   moveTo p1, cubicTo p2, cubicTo p3, lineTo p1

   smooth p1, p2, p3, :smoothclose
   moveTo p1, cubicTo p2, cubicTo p3, cubicTo p1
   That last vertex (p1) does not count as being on the path. So the vertices are p1, p2 and p3.
   But both p1 and p3 are now smooth.

   line p1, p2, smooth p3, :close
   When a line connects to a smooth curve the curve bit is semismooth near the endpoints.
   That is we smooth the node, but there is only one handle to set.

   smooth p1, p2, p3, p1
   To get a 2 points smooth curve. At p1 the curve is not smooth, since it is twice an
   endpoint. But this is ugly. I must be able to say that a path is truly closed.

   vertex p1, smooth p2, p3, :close

   I think the rules must bend a little to make it more consistent.
   The vertices mentioned in a line expression are never smooth.
   Those mentioned in a smooth are ALL smooth.
   This implies :smoothclose becomes DEPRECATED. It is meaningless

   vertex p1, smooth p2, p3, :close

   p1 will not be smooth but p2 and p3 are. Nevertheless there are 3 cubics.

   line p1, p2, smooth p3, :close

   the segment p2-p3 must be a cubicTo(p2,p2, c3,p3)

   This also means that adding nodes may change the last one.

   Basicly we add vertices and these can be marked:
      - start(point). Counts as sharp,
      - end(point).  May be absent if subpath closes. Endpoints do not appear in the 'each_vertex' list
                   Counts as sharp.
      - sharp. as opposed to smooth
      - smooth.

   Using this scheme it is possible to add lines, moves etc...
   To avoid changing classes this just becomes a field of Vertex itself.
   The path can then be easily generated from this.

   Starting and ending is something else. It must be since line p1, p2
   is supposed to be different then smooth p1, p2.
   No, not really. endpoints cannot be smooth. And endpoints and starting points differ too.

   But the status may change.
   If I start line(p1,p2) and if I add p1 as :start, then how can I see the difference
   with smooth(p1,p2)? It seems we must delay setting :start and :end until we
   get a moveTo! If we get a :close we need not do anything after all!


   smooth p1, p2 is meaningless. However:

    line p1, p2, smooth p3, line p4

   is possible. Although a better syntax would be

    line p1, p2, smoothTo p3, lineTo p4

   What's the use of 'line' anyway.
   I would like to say that 'smooth' is a property of a vertex, and that paths are lists
   of vertices.  line v1, v2... just expresses the non-smoothness.
   But then [v1, v2] would be a better notation.
   Get into trouble with

    invalid syntax
      [v1, v2 smooth s3, s4  v5, v6 ]

    Then this:
      [v1, v2]
      smooth s3, s4
      [v5, v6]

   [] will not work properly, obviously. Stupid idea.

   Let's stick to line and smooth for the time being
